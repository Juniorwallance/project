# Highlights Backend Setup Guide

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the highlights backend working in your project:

### 1. Database Setup

First, run the database setup script:

```bash
# Open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost/setup_highlights.php
```

This will create the necessary database tables and insert sample data.

### 2. Test the API

Test that the API is working:

```bash
# Open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost/test_highlights_api.php
```

You should see green checkmarks for all tests.

### 3. View the Highlights Page

Open the highlights page:

```bash
# Open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost/highlights.html
```

The page should now load highlights dynamically from the database!

### 4. Admin Interface (Optional)

To manage highlights, use the admin interface:

```bash
# Open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost/admin_highlights.php
```

## Troubleshooting

### If highlights don't load:
1. Check that the database setup completed successfully
2. Verify the API is working by visiting `test_highlights_api.php`
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### If you get database errors:
1. Make sure MySQL is running
2. Check database credentials in `db.php`
3. Ensure the `rugby_network` database exists

### If the admin interface doesn't work:
1. Make sure you're logged in (visit `login.php` first)
2. Check that you have a user account in the database

## Next Steps

2. **User Authentication**: Implement proper login system
3. **File Uploads**: Add image/video upload functionality
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure responsive design
5. **Performance**: Add caching and optimization

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

2. Verify all files are in the correct locations
3. Test the API endpoints individually
4. Check database connectivity

The highlights backend is now fully integrated and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
